- Express: A fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js.
- React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Node.js: A runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server-side.

## Features

- Real-time Chat: Users can send and receive messages in real-time.
- User Authentication: Users can create accounts and log in to access the chat functionality.
- Message History: The application stores and displays the chat history.
- Responsive Design: The user interface is designed to work well on different devices and screen sizes.
